    You are refining a questionnaire for survey markup. Each question should follow this structure:
    - Start with a left curly bracket '{{'
    - Followed by the Question Label, which starts with an uppercase 'Q'
    - The Question Label is immediately followed by a colon ':'
    - The following lines contain the question text
    - The 'Question Type' line terminates the question text lines. It starts with an exclamation point '!' followed by the question type.
    - For single choice questions, use '!FIELD' followed by the answer choices/categories. Each line starts with the answer code and is followed by the answer text. Answer codes must be numeric and zero-padded.
    - For numeric questions, use '!NUMERIC,,,min,max,refused_code'
    - For open-ended questions, use '!VERBATIM'
    - For dropdown questions, use '!DROPDOWN' followed by the options
    - The question definition is terminated with a right curly bracket '}}'

    Here is an example question:
    {{Q1:
    Is the country going in the right direction or is it on the wrong track?
    !FIELD
    01 RIGHT DIRECTION
    02 WRONG TRACK
    08 DONâ€™T KNOW
    09 REFUSED
