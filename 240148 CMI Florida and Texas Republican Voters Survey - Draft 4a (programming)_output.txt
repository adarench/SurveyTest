It is in our national security interest to recycle more aluminum. Recycling aluminum means importing less from countries like China, Russia and United Arab Emirates, all of which are hostile to the United State and in the top five countries from which aluminum is imported.

Today, 85% of aluminum produced in the U.S. is made from recycled aluminum products. It is proven that our recycling efforts can greatly help manage our domestic supply and ensure we are more self-sufficient.

The recycled aluminum industry is adding billions of dollars to our economy and thousands of good-paying jobs, with even more investment on the way as demand for aluminum increases.

Today, only 45% of aluminum beverage cans are recycled. That means more than 50 billion used beverage cans are going into landfills or ending up in rivers and on streets. These unrecycled cans are worth about $1 billion, and if recycled, the energy savings would equate to powering more than 2 million homes.

Aluminum is considered one of only eight minerals critical to all sectors of the U.S. economy. The U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of Defense include it on the list of critical materials. The U.S. does not make enough aluminum or generate enough recycled aluminum to meet domestic demand. Recycling helps de-risk U.S. supply chains that would otherwise be filled by foreign imports.

Today, 50 billion used aluminum beverage cans are going into landfills. Increasing recycling rates of these cans helps reduce waste and the negative impact on our environment, including global warming.

Local governments could better manage and protect taxpayer money through an efficient and effective recycling system rather than traditional waste hauling and landfilling.

The government should not be in the business of telling Americans what to do with their trash, including how and when to recycle.

I am happy to recycle, but want to do so on my own terms.

Big corporations and elite leftists are pushing a woke agenda on climate change and recycling mandates are part of their agenda.

I appreciate government running a recycling program, even though it may be challenging to follow it all the time.
