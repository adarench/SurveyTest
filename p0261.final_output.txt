!UNKNOWN
}

{Q27:
One way to conserve working farms, ranches, water, and wildlife habitat is through voluntary conservation land agreements with willing, private landowners. In exchange for a payment or a tax incentive, landowners agree not to develop their land or to sell it for development so that the land remains as farms, wildlife habitat or natural areas. Landowners can continue to farm, ranch or use their land, and can sell the land or pass it on to their children or grandchildren.

Limits certain types of uses or prevents development from taking place on the land to protect its value as a natural area, open space, farm or ranchland, now and in the future
!UNKNOWN
}

{Q35:
(ASK OF SAMPLE A)
Keeps land in private hands and preserves traditional land uses, such as family farming and ranching 
Prevents land from being used in a more profitable way, which limits tax revenue especially for rural communities  
Provides little value to local residents, since public access is often not allowed on private lands.  
Can end up creating unfair tax breaks benefiting wealthy large landowners 
Permanently restricts all future owners from developing the land
!UNKNOWN
}

{Q36:
(ASK OF SAMPLE B)
Makes it possible to keep farms and ranches in operation and protected from development 
Hurts rural economies as it limits future development which could create jobs and generate more in taxes
Generates revenue for the local community, because landowners continue to pay property taxes 
Allows non-profit organizations and government to protect more land from development, because it is less expensive than buying the land outright 
Can be limited to a certain period of time, such as ten to twenty years, where the land cannot be developed

As noted earlier there’s a number of different ways to refer to this approach to conserving natural areas, wildlife habitat and working farms or ranches.

Require that County Commissioners have to vote to approve all future land conservation agreements entered into by landowners in their county

ASK SAMPLE A: According to the American Farmland Trust, the United States loses 2,000 acres of farmland every single day, mostly to encroaching cities and development. Continuing to allow American farmers and ranchers to enter into land conservation agreements will help ensure family farms are passed on to the next generation and stay in the family, will help ensure local food production, and will retain the character of many small-town communities.

{Q49:
Voluntary land conservation agreements are one of the most cost effective ways to help conserve natural areas, wildlife habitat and farms and ranches. By allowing landowners to continue to care for their land as they do now, we ensure a stable tax base and reduce the cost to taxpayers of new roads and infrastructure that often comes with new development.
!UNKNOWN
}

{Q50:
Land conservation agreements help protect vital wildlife habitat and migration routes that are increasingly threatened by growth and development. Having healthy, abundant wildlife not only contributes to our quality of life, but is often an economic engine for rural areas that rely on people coming to fish, hunt, or view wildlife.
!UNKNOWN
}

{Q51:
ASK SAMPLE A: One million acres of land every year are lost to development – that’s the size of Phoenix, Los Angeles and Houston combined that every year become subdivisions, highways, and strip malls. Conserving our natural areas, farmland, and forests is important to the character of our communities, our quality of life, and to the future of our state.
!UNKNOWN
}

{Q52:
Voluntary land conservation agreements have been used for one hundred years and have endured because landowners WANT to conserve their land. Studies suggest that the vast majority of funds go directly back into agricultural operations and expansion, providing family farms stability in down years, and ensuring lands are able to be passed on to the next generation.
!UNKNOWN
}

{Q53:
Land conservation agreements are primarily used to conserve land as wildlife habitat, ranches or farms, but they can have other benefits. For example, the military has supported these voluntary agreements near its bases in some states to ensure houses are not built nearby which avoids conflicts and ensures they can train using all necessary equipment.
!UNKNOWN
}

{Q54:
Land conservation agreements provide many benefits to the public, such as protecting water and air quality, reducing the risk of flooding, conserving forest and woodlands, and ensuring local food production closer to communities. By simply maintaining the land the way it has been used for generations, communities can see a positive return of at least 4 dollars for every 1 invested in voluntary land conservation of forests, farms and ranches.
!FIELD
04 dollars for every 1 invested in voluntary land conservation of forests, farms and ranches.

These agreements are just a backhanded way for environmental organizations to seize control of private property. These groups help landowners broker deals with the government, then turn around and become the "managers" of how the land is used, telling landowners what they can and can’t do with their own land.
!UNKNOWN
}

{Q60:
Government is mostly benefiting the wealthy out of state who use these agreements as a tool to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. They come at the expense of millions of hard-working taxpayers at a time when many are struggling to pay the bills each month.
!UNKNOWN
}

{Q61:
These agreements mostly benefit big environmental organizations without fully compensating private property owners. These organizations secure the interest in the land without ever fully explaining the impacts to the landowner, are done on the cheap, and are only intended to add acres to Biden’s 30 by 30 scheme.
!FIELD
30 by 30 scheme.

{Q62:
These agreements are just another federal land grab as we are federalizing our private property rights. The government uses conservation easements to control private property rights without having to acquire those rights themselves.

{Q63:
(SAMPLE A) Once this limitation on a landowner is agreed upon, the terms last forever. Even if the land is sold or inherited, the original terms of the agreement apply.

{Q64:
(SAMPLE B) These agreements are contracts with the government that continue forever, even when land is passed down within the family or sold to a new owner. We don't know what kind of economic and ecological changes will occur in the coming years, and with this kind of agreement a landowner would not be allowed to make changes or enhancements to their land in response.
!UNKNOWN
}

{Q65:
These agreements represent a huge loss of revenue and opportunity for local governments. Landowners pay lower property taxes on land under an easement, which means less revenue for things like roads, schools and other needed services in rural communities. (modified from Heritage)
!UNKNOWN
}

{Q66:
These agreements hurt the economies of rural areas by ensuring that land can never be used for productive purposes that would help spur economic growth where it is often needed the most. That means children in rural areas are leaving to seek economic opportunities.
!UNKNOWN
}

{Q67:
These agreements are not necessary. Over a third of our country is owned by some level of government, and the federal government has regulatory power over even more. Private lands already provide hundreds of millions of acres of habitat without necessarily being removed from tax rolls, and there is no reason to expect these private lands will be developed on a massive scale.
