The AMA represents the interests of physicians in the U.S. well 
The AMA is an impactful and effective advocacy organization
The AMA is focused on and addresses the most important issues impacting physicians in the U.S. today


(SHOW ALL) (SHOW THIS ON SCREEN BY ITSELF AS A TRANSITION) 
Moving on and thinking about different issues and challenges today in the practice of medicine and health care…

(SAMPLE C) 
If you could give the AMA some advice regarding the policies you think they should support to improve Medicare, what do you think they should focus on that would be most helpful? What would you recommend in terms of how to improve Medicare?

(SAMPLES E/F) (Q5:1 – EMPLOYED PRACTICING PHYSICIANS)
If you could give the AMA some advice regarding the policies you think they should support that are impacting employed physicians like you, what do you think they should focus on that would be most helpful for employed physicians? What are the major issues you are encountering?  

INSERT TEXTBOX


Next, listed below are some broad topic and issue areas that physicians have mentioned as being important for physician advocacy organizations like the American Medical Association (AMA) to address on behalf of physicians in the U.S. For each, please record how high of a priority you think this should be for the AMA to address. (RANDOMIZE) 

Do you think it should be the single most important priority for AMA to address, a high priority but not the single most important, a medium priority, a low priority, or not a priority at all?

Single Most		High		Medium	Low		Not At All
Important Priority	Priority		Priority		Priority		Priority
1			2		3		4		5 

Administrative and regulatory burdens – addressing payer-imposed barriers to care, such as prior authorization, reducing reporting requirements that do not contribute to better patient care, and health plan payment policy transparency

Digital health infrastructure – making digital health infrastructure more physician friendly such as improving EHR interoperability and practice management software, preserving coverage of telemedicine, supporting integration of artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools, and addressing government requirements and liability issues

Non-physician provider scope of practice expansions – opposing nurse practitioner and other non-physician professional scope of practice expansions and supporting physician-led team-based care

Physician wellness – supporting programs that promote physician well-being and ensure that physicians are protected when seeking care for their mental health and other wellness needs

Medicare payment reform – improving the Medicare physician payment system to support innovation in health care delivery, reduce administrative burdens, enhance the clinical relevance of reporting programs, and promote the financial viability of physician practices

Private practice sustainability efforts – ensuring that physicians in private practice have access to the necessary support to remain financially viable and helping reduce industry mergers and consolidations of physician private practices  

Medical education and physician workforce issues – addressing graduate medical education funding, physician workforce shortages, workforce diversity, medical student debt, and medical student and resident rights

Patient mental and behavioral access issues – mental health coverage, parity in coverage, and access to treatment, including for substance use disorders


Government interference in the practice of medicine – oppose politically influenced policies that mandate or prohibit specific services or types of care, or impact patient-physician communications and decision-making

Health insurance coverage – supporting efforts to enroll uninsured patients in ACA plans, Medicaid expansion in states, and expanding Medicare coverage benefits for seniors


Now, if you learned that the AMA is working on addressing all these issues as part of their efforts to advocate on behalf of physicians, does this give you a much more favorable, somewhat more favorable, somewhat less favorable, or much less favorable opinion of the AMA or does it not make a difference in your opinion of the AMA one way or the other?

Much more favorable
Somewhat more favorable
Somewhat less favorable
Much less favorable
No Difference
