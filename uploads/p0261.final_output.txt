{Q12:
Thinking some more about land, water, and wildlife habitat in your state – 
One way to conserve working farms, ranches, water, and wildlife habitat is through voluntary conservation land agreements with willing, private landowners. In exchange for a payment or a tax incentive, landowners agree not to develop their land or to sell it for development so that the land remains as farms, wildlife habitat or natural areas. Landowners can continue to farm, ranch or use their land, and can sell the land or pass it on to their children or grandchildren.  
These agreements are sometimes referred to as conservation easements. Prior to this survey, have you seen, read or heard of a conservation easement before?
!DROPDOWN
- Yes, a lot
- Yes, a little 
- No, not heard of

And do you support or oppose continuing to allow private landowners the ability to conserve their lands as working farms, ranches, natural areas and wildlife habitat in your state through these voluntary land conservation agreements?

From the following list of proposed names, please rate each name on an imaginary thermometer from zero degrees to one hundred degrees, where zero means you have a very cold/unfavorable reaction and 100 means you have a very warm/favorable reaction, with fifty being neither cold nor warm.  Remember, you can use any number between zero to one hundred depending on how cold or warm you feel about each different name. (RANDOMIZE)

{Q15:
Some elected officials have raised concerns that these land conservation agreements can limit the economic and productive use of lands, which could hurt the economy and limit tax revenues for counties.

For each one of these, please indicate if that sounds like something you would support or oppose in your state. (RANDOMIZE)

- Developers take advantage of small farm and ranch families by buying up their land, forever changing the rural character of our communities. These voluntary land conservation agreements are a critical tool to defend our communities from these attacks. 
- Families should be able to decide how they will use their land now and for future generations through voluntary land conservation agreements, without being told what to do by the government.
}

{Q17:
Land conservation agreements help protect vital wildlife habitat and migration routes that are increasingly threatened by growth and development. Having healthy, abundant wildlife not only contributes to our quality of life, but is often an economic engine for rural areas that rely on people coming to fish, hunt, or view wildlife.

- These agreements are just a backhanded way for environmental organizations to seize control of private property. These groups help landowners broker deals with the government, then turn around and become the "managers" of how the land is used, telling landowners what they can and can’t do with their own land. 
- Government is mostly benefiting the wealthy out of state who use these agreements as a tool to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. They come at the expense of millions of hard-working taxpayers at a time when many are struggling to pay the bills each month.
